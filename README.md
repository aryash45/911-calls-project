This project involves an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of 911 call records, leveraging Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The analysis provides insights into the distribution, frequency, and patterns of emergency calls based on factors such as call type, location, time of day, and other relevant attributes.

Key highlights include:


Identifying peak call times and days.

Exploring call type categories and their trends.

Geographical distribution of calls for targeted response analysis.

Visualizing patterns through heatmaps, bar plots, and time-series graphs.

This project demonstrates proficiency in data preprocessing, statistical analysis, and visualization techniques.
